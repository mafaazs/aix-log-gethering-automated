Make the script executable:
In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the log_gather.sh script and make it executable with the following command:
bash

#chmod +x log_gather.sh

Test the script:
Run the script to make sure it is working as expected and that it can gather the logs properly.
bash

#./log_gather.sh

Set up crontab:
Open the crontab editor by running the following command:


#crontab -e

This will open the crontab file in your default text editor.

Schedule the script:
Add a new line at the end of the crontab file to schedule the script to run at your desired interval. For example, if you want to run it every day at midnight, you can add the following line:

0 0 * * * /path/to/log_gather.sh

The above line means the script will run at 00:00 (midnight) every day.

Save and exit the crontab editor:
In most text editors, you can save and exit by pressing Ctrl+X, followed by Y to confirm saving, and then Enter.
Now your automated log gathering tool is set up to run at the scheduled time, and it will collect the specified logs into the output file. Make sure to replace /path/to/log/directory with the actual directory path where your log files are located, and /path/to/output/logfile.log with the desired path for the output log file. Also, adjust the list of LOG_FILES according to the log files you want to gather.
